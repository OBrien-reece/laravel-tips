# laravel-tips

The project is divided into many growing branches each with its own type of code

Over the course of time (I do not know how long), I will add more repos of the tips i learn from people on youtube

I will document all the branches essentials for easier understanding

<ol>
<li>catch_exceptions - Branch where I tested how to handle exceptions</li>
<li>db_transactions - Branch where I tested DB::transaction facade</li>
<li>static_pages - Branch where I tested how refactor Routes and Controller using __invoke method</li>
<li>laravel_components - Branch where implemented Laravel Blade components to avoid code dulication</li>
<li>dbseeds - Branch where I implemented database seeding to automate migrations</li>
</ol>
